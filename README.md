# ravenous
### Part of the Codeacademy pro final project

# Objective

 Over the next couple of weeks, you’ll build a website called “Ravenous”, a Yelp-like clone.
In total, there will be four parts to this project:
* Creating Static Components
* Passing Information to Components
* Setting the State of Ravenous Components
* Interacting with the Yelp API

In the first installment, you will start by building the first part of Ravenous: *Creating Static Components*.
Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:
* As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
* As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
* As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React, all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone.
